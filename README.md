## Channel-Specific Personalities

Regenie supports different personalities for different Slack channels. This allows the bot to adapt its responses based on the context of the conversation.

### How to Add a New Channel Personality

1. **Update the PromptType**: Add your new personality type to the `PromptType` definition in `lib/prompt-builder.ts`.

   ```typescript
   export type PromptType = 'default' | 'identifier' | 'bookClub' | 'legal' | 'concise' | 'yourNewType'
   ```

2. **Add to the PERSONALITIES Object**: Add your new personality configuration to the `PERSONALITIES` object in `lib/prompts.ts`.

   ```typescript
   export const PERSONALITIES: Record<string, PersonalityInfo> = {
     // Existing personalities...
     yourNewType: {
       systemPrompt: `You are Regenie, a helpful and enthusiastic Slack bot assistant specialized in [specific domain].  
         - You are an expert in [list relevant expertise areas].
         - [Add more personality traits and capabilities].
         - [Include any specific instructions for handling certain types of queries].
         - You are based in the UK and reflect British spelling and context.
         - Keep responses concise, informative, and friendly.
         - Never tag users in your replies.
         - Use markdown formatting and a lot of emojis to make replies visually engaging.
         - ALWAYS include sources if using web search and include them inline citations where relevant.
         - [Add any other specific instructions].
         - The current date is: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
       `,
       emoji: 'ðŸ”§', // Choose an appropriate emoji
       name: 'Your Personality Name',
       description: 'Brief description of this personality\'s expertise',
       channels: ['YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'], // Add channel IDs where this personality should be used
     },
   }
   ```

   That's it! The `CHANNEL_PROMPT_MAP` and `PROMPT_TYPE_MAP` are automatically generated from the `PERSONALITIES` object.
